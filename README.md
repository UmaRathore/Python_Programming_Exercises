Python Exercises

Program_1: 
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included).The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Program2_Factorial:
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers. The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be:40320

Reverse_string:
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

Sum_of_two_integers_level1:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such
that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, 
and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.


Sum_of_two_integers_level2:
Get size of array from user and its values as integers, return indices of the two numbers such
that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and 
you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

Fizz Buzz:
Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i if non of the above conditions are true.

First_Unique_Character_String:
Given a string s, return the first non-repeating character in it and return its index.
If it does not exist, return -1.

Single_number:
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Intersection_two_arrays:
Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must
appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.

duplicate_values_array:
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array,
and return false if every element is distinct.

missing_number:
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range
that is missing from the array.
Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?

move_zeros:
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero
elements.Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

power_of_three:
Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false.
An integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n == 3powerx.

Array_merge_overlapping_time_intervals
You are given an array (list) of interval pairs as input where each interval has a start and end timestamp.
The input array is sorted by starting timestamps. 
You are required to merge overlapping intervals and return a new output array.

Arrays_move_zeros_to_left:
Given an integer array, move all elements that are 0 to the left
while maintaining the order of other elements in the array. The array has to be modified in-place.
Try it yourself before reviewing the solution and explanation.

reverse_words_string:
Reverse words in a sentence "Hello World"

reverse_characters_string:
Reverse the order of words in a given sentence (an array of characters).

string_segmented_from_dict_values
You are given a dictionary of words and a large input string.
You have to find out whether the input string can be completely segmented into the words of a given dictionary.

best_time_sell_buy_stocks
Dynamic Programming: Find maximum single sell profit Given a list of daily stock prices(integers for
simplicity), return the buy and sell prices for making the maximum profit. We need to maximize the
single buy / sell profit.If we can’t make any profit, we’ll try to minimize the loss.

pair_sum
Pair Sums. Given a list of n integers arr[0..(n-1)], 
determine the number of different pairs of elements within it which sum to k.
If an integer appears in the list multiple times, each copy is considered to be different; that is, 
two pairs are considered different if one pair includes at least one array index which the other doesn't, 
even if they include the same values.

balanced_parenthesis_stack
 The sequence is composed of two or more non-empty sequences, all of which are balanced, or
The first and last brackets of the sequence are matching, and the portion of the sequence without the first and 
last elements is balanced. You are given a string of brackets. 
Your task is to determine whether each sequence of brackets is balanced. 
If a string is balanced, return true, otherwise, return false

binary_tree
Inorder traversal, print all nodes
