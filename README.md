Python Exercises

Program_1: 
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included).The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Program2_Factorial:
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers. The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be:40320

Reverse_string:
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

Sum_of_two_integers_level1:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such
that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, 
and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.


Sum_of_two_integers_level2:
Get size of array from user and its values as integers, return indices of the two numbers such
that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and 
you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

Fizz Buzz:
Given an integer n, return a string array answer (1-indexed) where:
answer[i] == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
answer[i] == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
answer[i] == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
answer[i] == i if non of the above conditions are true.

First_Unique_Character_String:
Given a string s, return the first non-repeating character in it and return its index.
If it does not exist, return -1.

Single_number:
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

Intersection_two_arrays:
Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must
appear as many times as it shows in both arrays and you may return the result in any order.

duplicate_values_array:
Given an integer array nums, return true if any value appears at least twice in the array,
and return false if every element is distinct.

missing_number:
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range
that is missing from the array.
Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?

move_zeros:
Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero
elements.Note that you must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.

power_of_three:
Given an integer n, return true if it is a power of three. Otherwise, return false.
An integer n is a power of three, if there exists an integer x such that n == 3powerx.
