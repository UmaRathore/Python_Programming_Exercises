Python Exercises

Program_1: 
Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5, between 2000 and 3200 (both included).The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

Program2_Factorial:
Write a program which can compute the factorial of a given numbers. The results should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be:40320

Reverse_string:
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

Sum_of_two_integers_level1:
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such
that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.


Sum_of_two_integers_level2:
Get size of array from user and its values as integers, return indices of the two numbers such
that they add up to target. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
You can return the answer in any order.
